![Alt Text](https://s1.ezgif.com/tmp/ezgif-1-347e95081b.gif)

This repository contains a C++ implementation of the classic Snake game. The game is designed to run in a command-line interface and uses the Standard Template Library (STL) and `windows.h` for efficient data handling and display updates.

## Features

- **Data Structures:** The game uses a 2D vector to represent the grid and a queue to manage the snake's body, tracking its movement on the grid.
- **Input-Driven Movement:** The snake moves only when the player provides input, making it an interactive, user-controlled experience.
- **Display Updates:** The game uses `system('cls')` to clear and refresh the console after each move, simulating the snake's movement.
- **Platform:** The game is designed to run on Windows, utilizing `windows.h` for console manipulation.

## Installation

To compile and run the game, ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your Windows system (e.g., g++ or Visual Studio). Clone the repository and compile the code using the following commands:
